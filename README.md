# Software Quality Engineering - System Testing
This is a repository for the system-testing assignment of the Software Quality Engineering course at the [Ben-Gurion University](https://in.bgu.ac.il/), Israel.

## Assignment Description
In this assignment, we tested an open-source software called [Moodle](https://sandbox.moodledemo.net/).

Moodle is a website that is generally used in an educational scope by students and teachers/professors. Teachers upload material for specific
courses, create assignments and many other functionalities/features, and the courses are accessible to the students that are eligible for the 
courses.

## Installation
We didn't perform any installations to use the sandbox as we used the one available online by the course.

## What we tested
We tested the assignment module that allows for creating and uploading solutions to assignment. We chose to test the following user stories:

*User story:* a student submits a solution to an assignment and the teacher deketes the assignment

*Preconditions*: there is an assignment in the course

*Expected outcome*: the student successfully submitted and teacher successfully deletes the assignment


*User story:* while the student is in the submission form of an assignment, the teacher deletes it.

*Preconditions:*  there is an assignment in the course

*Expected outcome:* the student fails to submit the assignment


*User story:* the teacher deletes an assignment while the student is about to add a submission

*Precoditions:* there is an assignment in the course

*Expected outcome:* the student fails to add a submission to the deleted assignment


*User story:* the teacher deletes an assignment while the student is about to enter the assignment

*Precoditions:* there is an assignment in the course

*Expected outcome:* the student fails to enter to the deleted assignment


*User story:* the teacher deletes an assignment prior to the student entering the course

*Precoditions:* there is an assignment in the course

*Expected outcome:* the student enters the course without seeing an assignment


## How we tested
We used two different testing methods:
1. [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/), a behavior-driven testing framework.
2. [Provengo](https://provengo.tech/), a story-based testing framework.

Each of the testing methods is elaborated in its own directory. 

## Results
Update all README.md files (except for d-e, see Section 1). Specifically, replace all $$*TODO*â€¦$$ according to the instructions inside the $$.
